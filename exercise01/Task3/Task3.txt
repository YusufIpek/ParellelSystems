Solution 1:
Changing the array access of matrix b increases the computation speed of the multiplication operation. Matrix b is accessed as row same as matrix a, so whole row is loaded
to the cache and the data can be accessed from the cache without needing to load data from RAM each time when accessing matrix b, this leads to fewer cache misses.
Prerequisite is that matrix b has to be transposed, but as matrix b is a identity matrix no transpose required.

example:
c[i][j] = a[i][k]*b[j][k]

Solution 2:
Tiling the array to smaller portions to utilize the cache. 6 for loops required.
